# Myecinema

Application allowing to find cinemas & seances, booking seats, buying
tickets, etc. The project was developing in a small team, with the support of experienced programmers in the Discord Community. 
Here I was learning how to use GIT with a team, write Unit Tests, creating code obeying SOLID, and other Clean Code principles.Â 

The project has been suspended due to the start of the internship season.

( With great result ! :D )
